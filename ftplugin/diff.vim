" Get fold level for diff mode
" Works with normal, context, unified, rcs, ed, subversion and git diffs.
" For rcs diffs, folds only files (rcs has no hunks in the common sense)
" foldlevel=1 ==> file
" foldlevel=2 ==> hunk
" context diffs need special treatment, as hunks are defined
" via context (after '***************'); checking for '*** '
" or ('--- ') only does not work, as the file lines have the
" same marker.
" Inspired by Tim Chase.
